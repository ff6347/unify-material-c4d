##create unique materials in C4D for E3D  
This script is aimed to be a little helper for C4D noobs like me to create 3D objects that can be used within After Effects with Element3D. E3D recognizes materials from C4D. But only unique ones. I think it is not the normal C4D way to have lots of separte materials. And comming from the programming side the C4D way is the object oriented one. But still - If I e.g.  
- make a cube  
- use a replicator  
- scatter them in space  
- save the file  
I still have one material when i load the file in AE + E3D. I can use multiobjects. Shure. But what if I want to isolate one specific cube? In C4D I have to manually asign diffrent materials to all my objects. That can be a tidious work with hundreds of them.  
This script does the trick.  

###Usage  
- make your 3D graphic  
- make all the objects unique  
- select all the objects you want to have unique materials  
- run the script
